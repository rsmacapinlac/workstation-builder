# Workstation Builder Repository Overview

> **Note:** Always consult the latest `README.md` file in this repository for the most up-to-date and authoritative information about setup, structure, and usage.

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and roles for setting up a complete Linux workstation. It is designed to work in conjunction with the `dots` repository for a full system and user configuration.

## Purpose
- Automate system-level setup and package installation
- Configure system-wide settings and services
- Set up development environments and tools
- Provide reproducible infrastructure for Linux workstations

## Structure
- `arch/`: Configuration for Arch Linux systems
- `debian/`: Configuration for Debian-based systems
- `bin/`: Helper scripts and utilities

## Testing the Arch playbook
To test Ansible Arch playbooks:
```bash
cd ~/workspace/workstation-builder/arch
ansible-playbook core.yml -K -vv
```

- Use `-v` for verbose output
- Test specific roles with targeted playbooks

## Relationship to dots
- `workstation-builder` sets up the system, installs packages, and configures services
- `dots` applies user-level and application-specific configuration
- Both are designed to be modular and easily customizable
